## The Brain Games Project
#### Description
_Brain Games_  is a package of five CLI-based games whose gameplay is similar to some popular 'brain teaser' mobile apps. Each game generates a set of problems. Solve three problems to complete a game. A wrong answer means a game over and restart. The following games are featured:

- _Even-Odd Game_. Tell whether a number is even or odd.
- _Calculator Game_. Solve arithmetic problems.
- _GCD Game_. Find the greatest common divisor of a pair of numbers.
- _Progression Game_. Find the number missing from a sequence.
- _Prime Game_. Tell whether a number is prime.
